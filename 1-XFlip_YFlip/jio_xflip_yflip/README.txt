Homework 01
===========

Goal :
  Implement Flipx, Flipy using only generic C

Explanation :
  This program will read `lena.raw` and X/Y-flip it. It will be repeated 2000
  times. The result will be exported as `c_xflip.raw` and `c_yflip.raw`. All
  the inputs will be read and all the outputs will be written into the current
  working directory.

Tested Environment :
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (16.6.5) on Windows 10 (x64)
  - AMD Ryzen 7 3700X

Example Output :
  > Opening image... OK
  > Testing C XFlip... 0.14651 ms
  > Testing C YFlip... 0.152595 ms
  > Saving results... OK

For assembly code, refer to `DASM_*.txt`.

Done.
